This is maniview, a Geomview module for viewing 3D manifolds.  It was
written by Charlie Gunn (gunn@geomview.org) at the University of
Minnesota Geometry Center.

Description
-----------
This is the `maniview' emodule. `emodules' are kind of plugins which
extend the functionality of Geomview (an interactive 3d viewing
program). Geomview is available separately from Sourceforge. Please
see www.geomview.org for more information.

Required Packages
-----------------
You need the XForms library to compile the maniview emodule. XForms is
available from

http://www.nongnu.org/xforms/

Also, as this is an extension module for Geomview, you need also to
install Geomview; you have to do this first. See

http://www.geomview.org/ (aka http://geomview.sourceforge.net/)

Quick
~~~~~
You have to install the XForms library and Geomview first; afterwards
you can install this package like you would install any other GNU
autoconf based package. See the file ./INSTALL for generic
installation instructions.

Quick install instructions: if Geomview and the XForms library were
installed in their default locations, then all you need to do is

./configure --prefix=PREFIX && make install

to configure, compile and install the emodule. This, however, requires
that you have write permissions for `PREFIX/libexec/geomview/' (were
PREFIX defaults to `/usr/local/', if the `--prefix' option has not been
specified).

Local Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install the maniview emodule locally, run configure with the
`--enable-local-emodule' switch:

./configure --prefix=PREFIX --enable-local-emodule && make install

This still will install the binary under `PREFIX/libexec/geomview/',
but writes the emodule definition into the file

~/.geomview-maniview

were Geomview will find it. So, for a local installation you would --
perhaps -- do the following:

./configure --prefix=${HOME}/software --enable-local-emodule && make install

This would produce the two files

${HOME}/software/libexec/geomview/maniview
${HOME}/.geomview-maniview

`.geomview-maniview' will contain the full path to the `maniview' binary
in this case so that nothing more should be needed to call the maniview
emodule from within Geomview.

Global Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just configure Geomview and gvemod-maniview with the same `--prefix'
option; e.g. `--prefix=/usr'. This should work.

If you run configure with the switch `--enable-geomview-query' then
the installed version of Geomview -- if one is found -- will be
queried for the proper location for the emodule binaries and
definition files. Normally, this should not change anything, only when
Geomview is installed in a strange place.

Consider you had installed Geomview locally in your home-directory
below `${HOME}/Geomview' (by configuring the Geomview package with
`--prefix=${HOME}/Geomview'), and the XForms library below the prefix
`${HOME}/software/', then you could run configure like follows:

./configure --prefix=${HOME}/software --enable-geomview-query && make install

This would result in auto-detection of the XForms library and produce
the two files

${HOME}/Geomview/libexec/geomview/maniview
${HOME}/Geomview/libexec/geomview/.geomview-maniview

and again, this should result in a working configuration.

Special Switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configure script features some command line switches to fine-tune
the locations where it searches for needed packages (i.e. Geomview,
XForms, Xpm). Please use `configure --help' to get help about these.

HISTORY
-------
The Geomview project began in the summer of 1988 at the University of
Minnesota's Geometry Center with the work of Pat Hanrahan on a viewing
program called MinneView.  Shortly thereafter Charlie Gunn begin
developing OOGL in conjunction with MinneView.  In 1991 a team of
programmers headed by Mark Phillips, Stuart Levy, and Tamara Munzner
set about developing a revised version of OOGL and a new viewer which
they named Geomview.  In the time since then, many people have
contributed, including (in alphabetical order): Steve Anderson, Rex
Dieter, Celeste Fowler, Claus-Justus Heine, Todd Kaplan, Daniel Krech,
Mario Lopez, Daeron Meyer, Mark Meuer, Steve Robbins, Timothy Rowley,
Nathaniel Thurston, Scott Wisdom, Lloyd Wood and others.
