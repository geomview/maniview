Compiling and Installing Maniview
---------------------------------

Quick summary
-------------

    0. Make sure you have configured, built, and installed
       version 1.8.0 or higher of Geomview.

    1. Let GEOMROOT stand for the top level of your Geomview
       source tree.

	% cd GEOMROOT/src/bin
	% tar xvfz maniview-2.0.0.tar.gz

    2. Make sure you have configured Geomview with the 'XFORMS'
       library.

    3.  % cd GEOMROOT
	% ./configure

    4.  % cd GEOMROOT/src/bin/maniview
	% make
	% make install

    0. For the rest of this discussion, let GEOMROOT stand for the
       path of the top level directory of your Geomview source tree.
       Make sure you have at least version 1.8.0 of Geomview.

       These instructions assume that you have already configured,
       built, and installed Geomview on your system.  You can,
       however, configure and build both Geomview and maniview at the
       same time if you want.  See the note on "Simultaneous
       Configuring/Building" below for details on this.

    1. Unpack the maniview distribution into the "src/bin"
       subdirectory of your Geomview source tree.  Once you've done
       this, you should have a directory named something like
       GEOMROOT/src/bin/maniview-2.0.0, where 2.0.0 is replaced
       with whatever version of maniview you have.

    2. Maniview uses the XFORMS GUI library, so you need to configure
       the Geomview source tree to know about XFORMS before you can
       configure or build maniview.  If you don't know whether your
       Geomview source tree was configured with XFORMS, look for the
       string "have_xforms" in the file GEOMROOT/config.cache.  If
       that file doesn't exist, then Geomview hasn't been configured
       at all and you need to go through the entire Geomview
       configuration process, including configuring it for XFORMS.  If
       GEOMROOT/config.cache exists and the string "have_xforms=yes"
       appears in it (that string will be in the middle of a long line
       of other stuff), then your Geomview tree is configured with
       XFORMS.  Otherwise, follow the instructions in the file
       GEOMROOT/INSTALL.Geomview for configuring your Geomview source
       tree with XFORMS.

    3. If you did not end up having to run Geomview's top-level
       'configure' script (GEOMROOT/configure) in the previous step
       (i.e. if Geomview was already configured for XFORMS), re-run
       that configure script now:

	  % cd GEOMROOT
	  % ./configure [OPTIONS]

       Give it the same options, if any, that you used when you last
       ran it.  (If you're not sure what options you used, you can
       find out by looking in GEOMROOT/config.status).

       The point of this step is to make sure that GEOMROOT/configure
       gets run after maniview has been unpacked into
       GEOMROOT/src/bin.  If you ran GEOMROOT/configure in the course
       of setting up XFORMS above, and the maniview directory was
       present in src/bin at the time, then skip this step.

    4. If you have not installed Geomview (via "make install" in
       the GEOMROOT directory), do that now.  This will also build
       and install maniview.

       If you have already installed Geomview, then you can build
       and install maniview more quickly by doing:

          % cd GEOMROOT/src/bin/maniview
	  % make
	  % make install

       Note: maniview will not work properly when run from the
       Geomview source directory.  You need to actually "install"
       it in order for it to be able to find its data files.


Simultaneous Configuring/Building
---------------------------------

If you have just downloaded Geomview and maniview (and/or any other
Geomview module packages), you can configure, build, and install
everything in one fell swoop as follows:

  a. unpack the Geomview source tree; let GEOMROOT stand for the path
     of the top-level of this source tree (e.g. "geomview-1.8.0").
  b. unpack whatever module packages you have into the
     "GEOMROOT/src/bin" subdirectory
  c. get the XFORMS distribution for your machine and unpack it into
     GEOMROOT/xforms
  d. cd into the GEOMROOT directory and run 'configure', giving it
     whatever options are appropriate for your system
  e. type "make install" (from the GEOMROOT directory)

See GEOMROOT/INSTALL.Geomview for details on getting XFORMS and for
information about what options to pass to 'configure'.
