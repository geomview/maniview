	* configure.in: Make check for XFORMS emit warning only, rather
	than being a fatal error.  Set conditional HAVE_XFORMS if found.

	* Makefile.am: Only build if HAVE_XFORMS is set.

	* Set up maniview as a separate package with its own configure.in,
	  Makefile.am, etc, to be insertable into an existing Geomview
	  source tree.
